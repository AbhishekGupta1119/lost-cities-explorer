      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Pripyat, also known as Prypiat, is an abandoned industrial city in Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, located near the border with Belarus. Named after the nearby river, Pripyat, it was founded on 4 February 1970 as the ninth atomgrad ('atom city', a type of closed city in the Soviet Union that served the purpose of housing nuclear workers near a plant), catering the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is located north of the abandoned city of Chernobyl, after which it is named. Pripyat was officially proclaimed a city in 1979 and had ballooned to a population of 49,360 by the time it was evacuated on the afternoon of 27 April 1986, one day after the Chernobyl disaster.</p>

      <p>Due to its sudden evacuation and isolation within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Pripyat has become a time capsule of Soviet urban planning and a powerful symbol of nuclear catastrophe. Although it is located in Vyshhorod Raion, the abandoned municipality is administered directly from the capital of Kyiv. Pripyat is supervised by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine which manages activities for the entire Chernobyl exclusion zone. Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the entire population of Pripyat was moved to the purpose-built city of Slavutych.</p>

      <h2>Why it was abandoned</h2>
      <p>Pripyat was evacuated the day after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster due to the extreme levels of radiation released from Reactor No. 4. The residents were told they would be away for just a few days, but they were never allowed to return. The abandonment happened so quickly that personal belongings, schoolbooks, toys, and household items were left behind — now frozen in time.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Access to Pripyat, unlike cities of military importance, was not restricted before the disaster as the Soviet Union deemed nuclear power stations safer than other types of power plants. Nuclear power stations were presented as achievements of Soviet engineering, harnessing nuclear power for peaceful projects. The slogan "peaceful atom" (Russian: мирный атом, romanized: mirnyy atom) was popular during those times. The original plan had been to build the plant only 25 km (16 mi) from Kyiv, but the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, among other bodies, expressed concern that would be too close to the city. As a result, the power station and Pripyat[6] were built at their current locations, about 100 km (62 mi) from Kyiv.</p>

      <p>On the night of 26 April 1986, Reactor No. 4 exploded during a safety test, releasing radioactive materials into the atmosphere. Initially, no immediate evacuation order was given. However, by the afternoon of 27 April, over 1,100 buses were mobilized to evacuate Pripyat’s residents.</p>

      <p>By 1988, the city was declared uninhabitable, and any future plans for repopulation were abandoned. A new town, Slavutych, was built to house former residents and plant workers.</p>

      <h2>Post-Chernobyl disaster</h2>
      <p>In 1986, the city of Slavutych was constructed to replace Pripyat. After Chernobyl, this was the second-largest city for accommodating power plant workers and scientists in the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

      <p>One notable landmark often featured in photographs in the city and visible from aerial-imaging websites is the long-abandoned Ferris wheel located in the Pripyat amusement park, which had been scheduled to have its official opening five days after the disaster, in time for May Day celebrations.[8][9] The Azure Swimming Pool and Avanhard Stadium are two other popular tourist sites.</p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>
      <p>Today, Pripyat remains inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is visited only by researchers, journalists, and tourists under strict regulations. Nature has reclaimed much of the area — buildings are overgrown, and wildlife thrives in the absence of human activity.</p>

      <p>Though structurally deteriorating, Pripyat's buildings still stand as eerie monuments to the nuclear age. It has become a symbol of abandoned urban spaces and appears in documentaries, games, and films that explore themes of disaster and decay.</p>
